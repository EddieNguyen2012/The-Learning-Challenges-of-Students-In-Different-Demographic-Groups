# The Learning Challenges of Students In Different Demographic Groups
*This is a part of the College Reading and Learning Association Peer Educator Level 3 certification training that I 
participated during Fall 2024*

## Project Summary

The goal of this project is to investigate how students from different demographic groups (e.g.,
year in college, major, gender, or ethnicity) vary in their unique learning challenges (confidence categories) in their
academic journey. By understanding these variations, the project aims to provide insights for
developing tailored teaching strategies and support systems that focus on the specific needs of
each group. 

The main methodology of this project is to utilize Kruskal Wallis test to test the mean differences of confidence level
of learning challenges among the demographic groups. Then use bar plot visualization to determine the top 3 challenges 
that each demographic group likely has. 

The result of this project can be utilized as a guideline for Peer Educators about the potential challenges that students
from each demographic group may have to better assist them.

## Data Source

The data was collected by San Jose State University Peer Connections using survey method. The survey collects confidence
of students about some specific groups as well as their satisfaction about Learning Assistant service. This data was
collected before and after a regular semester from Fall 2022 to Fall 2023.
